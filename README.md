ROADMAP:
- Move biome calculations to compute shader or process shader
- Move normal calculations from terrain shader to compute/process shader for texture blending
- Add support for additional collision parameters (collision material)
- Make simple scatter system for trees and grass
- Move height image generation to thread
- Add support for multiple textures blending and voronoi biomes with different terrain
