# Clipmap3D
An infinite procedural terrain system for Godot 4.5+

## Overview
* Written in GDScript, GLSL, and GDShader.
* Procedurally generated and textured in real time by a customizable compute shader
* Over 30x30km render distance with configurable levels of detail (LODs)
* Real-time LOD shifting as the player moves
* Supports blending up to 32 albedo + normal textures
* Supports concave collision with physics bodies

## WIP Disclaimer
This project was started 2 weeks ago and is not suitable for production.
If you are interested in Clipmap3D, please try out the demo and report bugs.

## Roadmap
* Texture projection
* Double-resolution normal map generation
* Foliage instancing
* Origin shifting
